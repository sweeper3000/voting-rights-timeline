						<p>The Colonies at the time were becoming more self-governing, and this meant they could control who is elgible to vote. Due to all of them being heavily influenced by English law, only men owning property or assets of a specified value could vote. Paying a certain amount of taxes and rent could also qualify you. Women, minorities and Catholics could not vote.</p>
						<p>Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island did not have property requirements, for their own reasons and during certain time periods.</p>
						<p>Most Colonies also followed the practise of having voters take an oath. The oath specifically renounces the Pope's authority, affecting Catholics. Jews were also negativly impacted as the oaths referenced the Christian faith. Lastly, religious groups like the Quakers were prohibited by their religion from taking oaths.</p>
						<p>From 1791-1849, women regularly voted in Lower Canada and there were also reports of women sometimes voting in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.</p>
						<p>Upper and Lower Canada did not have religious qualifications and Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island soon removed theirs. Until 1833 however, Quakers still could not vote because the requirement to take an oath was still there.</p>

						<p>In 1867, provinces could still decide who can vote. All provinces restriced the right to vote to male British subjects at least 21 years of age. The federal elections and their administration was very partisan, at the mercy of the governing party. The electoral lists were drawn up by the governing party, or by the provinces in the case of a provincial election.</p>
						<p>Since elections were done by the provinces, it was very fragmented. Provinces held votes at different days and people could see who would win before they even vote.</p>
						<p>Patronage was very common in this era and this gave a huge incentive to vote for the governing party.</p>

						<p>In 1918, women were granted the right to vote in federal elections.</p>
						<p>In provincial elections, Manitoba was the first province to give women the right to vote in 1916. The last was Quebec in 1940. In 1951, the Northwest Territories was the last territory to grant women the right to vote.</p>
						<p>This was possible due to the enormous women's suffrage, which started campaigning as early as the 1870s despite opposition at the time.</p>

						<p>From the 19th century through most of the 20th, Asians were denied the right to vote. The <em>Electoral Franchise Act</em> prevented Chinese-Canadians from voting, but then new laws prevented all Asians from voting. By 1948, all restrictions on Asians voting were removed.</p>
						<p>First Nations could not vote unless they give up their Indian Status under the <em>Indian Act.</em></p>
						<p>Starting in 1948, the right to vote provincially was extended to Non-Status Indians, ending with Quebec in 1969. The right to vote federally was extended in 1950 to Non-Status Indians as well. By 1960, the right to vote was extended to all First Nations.i</p>
						<p>The Inuit could not vote until 1950. Still, they were not even added to electoral lists nor were ballot boxes brought to the Arctic until 1962.</p>

						<p>Over time, voting becomes easier by:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Employers required to provide enough time off during the work day to vote</li>
							<li>Voting hours extended</li>
							<li>Advance voting and voting by mail</li>
							<li>Ramps for people in wheelchairs and criteria is created for polling locations</li>
							<li>Mobile polls</li>
							<li>Voter information made available in both official languages and some Aboriginal languages</li>
							<li>Awareness programs designed to educate particularly those who may not know their democratic rights</li>
							<li>Magnifiers, large print lists of candidates, braille and tactile lists of candidates and voting templates and sign language interpretation</li>
						</ul>
						<p>All of these measures helped more Canadians vote and therefore present a more accurate political spectrum of Canada through elections.</p>

						<p>After the Charter was inplemented, several groups fought for the right to vote.</p>
						<p>In 2002, <em>Sauv√© v. Canada</em> gave inmates the right to vote.</p>
						<p>The Canadian Disability Rights Council helped give those with mental illnesses the right to vote</p>
						<p>Federally selected judges could vote.</p>
						<p>These groups getting the right to vote was largly due to sections 1 and 3 of the Charter, and the fact that these restrictions went against the Charter and could not be reasonably justified.</p>
